Hence, there are 52 training examples from each speaker. The speakers are grouped into sets of 30 speakers each, 4 groups can serve as training set, the last group as the test set. A total of 3 examples are missing, the authors dropped them due to difficulties in recording. \\n\\nThis is a good domain for a noisy, perceptual task. It is also a very good domain for testing the scaling abilities of algorithms. For example, C4.5 on this domain is slower than backpropagation!\\n\\n### Source\\n\\n* Creators: \\nRon Cole and Mark Fanty \\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering, \\nOregon Graduate Institute, Beaverton, OR 97006. \\ncole '@' cse.ogi.edu, fanty '@' cse.ogi.edu \\n\\n* Donor: \\nTom Dietterich \\nDepartment of Computer Science \\nOregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331 \\ntgd '@' cs.orst.edu\\n\\n### Attributes Information\\n  \\nAll attributes are continuous, real-valued attributes scaled into the range -1.0 to 1.0. The features are described in the paper by Cole and Fanty cited below. \\nThe features include spectral coefficients; contour features, sonorant features, pre-sonorant features, and post-sonorant features. The exact order of appearance of the features is not known.\\n\\n### Relevant papers\\n\\nFanty, M., Cole, R. (1991).  Spoken letter recognition.  \\nIn Lippman, R. P., Moody, J., and Touretzky, D.
