Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is     linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\nPredicted attribute: class of iris plant.  \\nThis is an exceedingly simple domain.  \\n \\n### Attribute Information:\\n    1. sepal length in cm\\n    2. sepal width in cm\\n    3. petal length in cm\\n    4. petal width in cm\\n    5. class: \\n       -- Iris Setosa\\n       -- Iris Versicolour\\n       -- Iris Virginica\\n\\nDownloaded from openml.org.\",\n",
